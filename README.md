## Key Elements of an NLI

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
This is essential for understanding and generating human language. It involves tokenization, syntax parsing, semantic analysis, etc.

### Machine Learning
Used to improve the interface's ability to understand and respond accurately.

### User Context and Intent
Capturing the context and intent behind user input to provide relevant responses.

### Conversational Design
Ensuring the flow of interaction feels natural and intuitive.

## Steps to Create an NLI

### Define the Use Case
Understand what you want the NLI to accomplish.

### Collect Data
Gather and preprocess data for training your NLP models.

### Build the NLP Pipeline
Tokenize, parse, and analyze the text.

### Train Machine Learning Models
Use data to train models that understand and generate language.

### Design User Interactions
Create scenarios and dialogues that users might interact with.

### Test and Iterate
Continuously test the interface and refine it based on user feedback.

## Tools and Libraries

### NLP Libraries
- SpaCy
- NLTK
- GPT-3 (via OpenAI API)

### Machine Learning Frameworks
- TensorFlow
- PyTorch

### Dialogue Management
- Rasa
- Microsoft Bot Framework

## CI Pipeline Setup

We use GitHub Actions for continuous integration (CI) in this repository. The CI pipeline is configured to run on every push and pull request.

### Pipeline Steps

1. **Checkout code**: Uses the `actions/checkout@v2` action to checkout the repository code.
2. **Set up Node.js**: Uses the `actions/setup-node@v2` action to set up Node.js version 14.
3. **Install dependencies**: Runs `npm install` to install the necessary npm dependencies.
4. **Run tests**: Runs `npm test` to execute the test suite.
5. **Deploy application**: Runs the deployment steps to deploy the application after the tests pass.
