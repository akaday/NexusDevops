## Key Elements of an NLI

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
This is essential for understanding and generating human language. It involves tokenization, syntax parsing, semantic analysis, etc.

### Machine Learning
Used to improve the interface's ability to understand and respond accurately.

### User Context and Intent
Capturing the context and intent behind user input to provide relevant responses.

### Conversational Design
Ensuring the flow of interaction feels natural and intuitive.

## Steps to Create an NLI

### Define the Use Case
Understand what you want the NLI to accomplish.

### Collect Data
Gather and preprocess data for training your NLP models.

### Build the NLP Pipeline
Tokenize, parse, and analyze the text.

### Train Machine Learning Models
Use data to train models that understand and generate language.

### Design User Interactions
Create scenarios and dialogues that users might interact with.

### Test and Iterate
Continuously test the interface and refine it based on user feedback.
